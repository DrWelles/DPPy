Welcome to DPPy's documentation!
################################

DPPy is a Python library for exact and approximate sampling of Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs).

This documentation, for both discrete and continuous DPP models, aims at collecting:

	1. the main mathematical background and intuitions,

	2. state-of-the-art sampling algorithms through Python objects in the :ref:`tutorials`.
